# Hello_World
i was exposed to the idea of open source coding while learning about bitcoin.
as an architect i was always fascinated by the constructs of our society, as i founded the bitembassy in tel aviv, i found the power of open source community.
values such as sharing, transparency and meritizem were complimented by our rights to cypherpunk privacy, free choice and expression.
i believe we are in the midst of an OpenSource revolution, it might not televised, but it will be posted on git hub
